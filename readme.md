# NewsCMS

## Another CMS!

Yes but this one has no goals to completely replace other CMS instead it has the goal of being simple yet extremely powerful. Although themeing is still supported plugins are not and there are no goals to support them in the future. The most powerful feature of NewsCMS is its real-time content capabilities. Getting news to the viewers faster than ever and with less page refreshes.
